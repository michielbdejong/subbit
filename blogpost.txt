* generated minimal circuits for functions in 3-to-1 bits
* experience optimizing script
* subbit = distinction between the current input valuation and other possible input valuations which would have another activation pattern.
* With 2 wires you can make 4 groups, but you have to put them back into either 2/2 or 3/1 groups to put the information back into one bit.
* This means a reduction from 12 to just 8 or 6 "subbits".
